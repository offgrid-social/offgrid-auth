# offgrid-auth

Reference implementation for offgrid identity and authentication.

Offgrid uses **key-based identities**, not account-based logins.

## Scope
- Identity generation
- Key management
- Session handling
- Optional federated authentication flows

## Security
Secrets and private keys are **never** committed to this repository.
Security depends on protocol correctness, not code secrecy.
